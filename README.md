HitboxPlaysUnity
================

HitboxPlaysUnity is a simple Unity behaviour that uses the GLaDOS hitbox bot to receive chat messages through IRC for use in Unity. See the source code for basic usage instructions, especially to understand how it uses your hitbox username and password. The GLaDOS IRC server is a third party from hitbox yet needs to receive your hitbox credentials to retrieve and send hitbox chat messages on behalf of you. For details on how the GLaDOS IRC hitbox chat works, visit [this page](http://www.reddit.com/r/hitbox/comments/1w6xnj/irc_update_on_irc_functionality_and_new/).

Currently the behaviour does not do anything but log the chat messages of the hitbox channel of the user you log in as to the Unity console.
